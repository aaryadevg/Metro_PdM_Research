  abstract = {The paper describes the MetroPT data set, an outcome of a Predictive Maintenance project with an urban metro public transportation service in Porto, Portugal. The data was collected in 2022 to develop machine learning methods for online anomaly detection and failure prediction. Several analog sensor signals (pressure, temperature, current consumption), digital signals (control signals, discrete signals), and GPS information (latitude, longitude, and speed) provide a framework that can be easily used and help the development of new machine learning methods. This dataset contains some interesting characteristics and can be a good benchmark for predictive maintenance models.},

abstract = {In Prognostic Health and Management (PHM) literature, the predictive maintenance studies can be classified into two groups. The first group focuses on the prognostics step but does not consider the maintenance decisions. The second group addresses the maintenance optimization question based on the assumptions that the prognostics information or the degradation models of the system are already known. However, none of the two groups provides a complete framework (from data-driven prognostics to maintenance decisions) investigating the impact of the imperfect prognostics on maintenance decision. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this gap of literature. It presents a novel dynamic predicive maintenance framework based on sensor measurements. In this framework, the prognostics step, based on the Long Short-Term Memory network, is oriented towards the requirements of operation planners. It provides the probabilities that the system can fail in different time horizons to decide the moment for preparing and performing maintenance activities. The proposed framework is validated on a real application case study. Its performance is highlighted when compared with two benchmark maintenance policies: classical periodic and ideal predicted maintenance. In addition, the impact of the imperfect prognostics information on maintenance decisions is discussed in this paper.}

abstract = {In a critical business sector such as the aviation industry, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction helps engineers schedule maintenance to avoid the risk of catastrophic failure in both the manufacturing and the servicing sectors. This paper attempts to review and evaluate various RUL predictive models for aircraft engines and compare their performance with a proposed Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) method based on a data-driven machine learning approach. This study uses the C-MAPSS datasets in order to evaluate the performance and the results of each approach. The obtained outcomes show that the modified LSTM method with Attention mechanism improves the RUL prediction for aircraft engines and provides better performance.}

abstract = {Remaining useful life (RUL) is the useful life left on an asset at a particular time of operation. Its estimation is central to condition based maintenance and prognostics and health management. RUL is typically random and unknown, and as such it must be estimated from available sources of information such as the information obtained in condition and health monitoring. The research on how to best estimate the RUL has gained popularity recently due to the rapid advances in condition and health monitoring techniques. However, due to its complicated relationship with observable health information, there is no such best approach which can be used universally to achieve the best estimate. As such this paper reviews the recent modeling developments for estimating the RUL. The review is centred on statistical data driven approaches which rely only on available past observed data and statistical models. The approaches are classified into two broad types of models, that is, models that rely on directly observed state information of the asset, and those do not. We systematically review the models and approaches reported in the literature and finally highlight future research challenges.}
